## What is LeetCode

If coding were a gym, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/pranjalig0204/) would be where I train my problem-solving muscles.  
It’s a place to learn algorithms, improve logic, and get ready for real-world coding challenges.

I mostly solve problems related to:
- Arrays, Strings, and Hashing  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming and Greedy techniques  

Sometimes I get it on the first try.  
Sometimes I stare at it for hours.  
Either way, I learn something every single time.
